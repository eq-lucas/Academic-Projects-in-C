# Academic-Projects-in-C 2024/2025

Aimed at developing generic, scalable, and efficient algorithms in C.


My projects in C apply low-level techniques such as dynamic memory allocation, memory defragmentation, system calls, and Assembly code for deeper optimizations.  
The focus is on energy efficiency and raw performance, with academic and professional goals in the development of these techniques and algorithms.
